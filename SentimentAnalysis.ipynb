    "XYZ organization, a global online retail giant, accumulates a vast number of customer reviews daily. Extracting sentiments from these reviews offers insights into customer satisfaction, product quality, and market trends. The challenge is to create an effective sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies XYZ customer reviews."

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure this ipynb file that you have cloned is in the __Project__ folder on the Desktop. The Dataset is also available in the same folder.\n",
    "2. Ensure that all the cells in the notebook can be executed without any errors.\n",
    "3. Once the Challenge has been completed, save the SentimentAnalysis.ipynb notebook in the __*Project*__ Folder on the desktop. If the file is not present in that folder, autoevalution will fail.\n",
    "4. Print the evaluation metrics of the model. \n",
    "5. Before you submit the challenge for evaluation, please make sure you have assigned the Accuracy score of the model that was created for evaluation.\n",
    "6. Assign the Accuracy score obtained for the model created in this challenge to the specified variable in the predefined function *submit_accuracy_score*. The solution is to be written between the comments `# code starts here` and `# code ends here`\n",
    "7. Please do not make any changes to the variable names and the function name *submit_accuracy_score* as this will be used for automated evaluation of the challenge. Any modification in these names will result in unexpected behaviour."
